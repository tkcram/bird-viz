Greater roadrunner,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75362461-1280px.jpg,2-6 eggs,3.5x2.8cm,"White covered with a chalky yellow film, sometimes stained with brown or gray.",19,,"Eyes closed but chick strong and active, with black skin and white down along the feather tracts.",730,1,2555,7,"A bird born to run, the Greater Roadrunner can outrace a human, kill a rattlesnake, and thrive in the harsh landscapes of the Desert Southwest. Roadrunners reach two feet from sturdy bill to white tail tip, with a bushy blue-black crest and mottled plumage that blends well with dusty shrubs. As they run, they hold their lean frames nearly parallel to the ground and rudder with their long tails. They have recently extended their range eastward into Missouri and Louisiana."
Blue jay,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75265841-1280px.jpg,2-7 eggs,2.5x1.8cm,Bluish or light brown with brownish spots.,17,34,"Naked and helpless, eyes closed, mouth lining red.",365,1,2555,7,"This common, large songbird is familiar to many people, with its perky crest; blue, white, and black plumage; and noisy calls. Blue Jays are known for their intelligence and complex social systems with tight family bonds. Their fondness for acorns is credited with helping spread oak trees after the last glacial period."
Northern cardinal,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75224371-1280px.jpg,2-5 eggs,2.2x1.7cm,"Grayish white, buffy white, or greenish white speckled with pale gray to brown.",11,18,"Naked except for sparse tufts of grayish down, eyes closed, clumsy.",365,0,1095,3,"The male Northern Cardinal is perhaps responsible for getting more people to open up a field guide than any other bird. They’re a perfect combination of familiarity, conspicuousness, and style: a shade of red you can’t take your eyes off. Even the brown females sport a sharp crest and warm red accents. Cardinals don’t migrate and they don’t molt into a dull plumage, so they’re still breathtaking in winter’s snowy backyards. In summer, their sweet whistles are one of the first sounds of the morning."
Trumpeter swan,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75226411-1900px.jpg,4-6 eggs,10.1x6.2cm,"Creamy to dull white, often stained brown in the nest.",32,33,"Eyes partially open, covered in mouse-gray or occasionally white down. Leaves nest within 24 hours of hatching and has the ability to swim and feed. Is able to fly at 90 - 122 days after hatching.",1460,1,9125,25,"Trumpeter Swans demand superlatives: they’re our biggest native waterfowl, stretching to 6 feet in length and weighing more than 25 pounds - almost twice as massive as a Tundra Swan. Getting airborne requires a lumbering takeoff along a 100-yard runway. Despite their size, this once-endangered, now recovering species is as elegant as any swan, with a graceful neck and snowy-white plumage. They breed on wetlands in remote Alaska, Canada, and the northwestern U.S., and winter on ice-free coastal and inland waters."
Dickcissel,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75340431-1900px.jpg,3-6 eggs,2x1.6cm,"Unmarked, pale blue.",12,20,"Nearly naked with sparse white down, helpless.",,0,1825,5,"The curt song of the Dickcissel sounds like the bird’s name, and it’s part of the soundtrack of the North American prairies. This chunky grassland bunting is colored like a miniature meadowlark, with a black V on a yellow chest. These birds are erratic wanderers—common across the middle of the continent, and a pleasant surprise whenever they turn up in pastures and fields elsewhere in the central and eastern United States. Dickcissels can form enormous flocks on migration and in winter."
Bald eagle,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75258921-1900px.jpg,1-3 eggs,5.8x4.7cm,"Dull white, usually without markings.",34,90,"Covered with light-gray down; eyes brown; gape, legs, and skin pink.",1460,1,7300,20,"The Bald Eagle has been the national emblem of the United States since 1782 and a spiritual symbol for native people for far longer than that. These regal birds aren’t really bald, but their white-feathered heads gleam in contrast to their chocolate-brown body and wings. Look for them soaring in solitude, chasing other birds for their food, or gathering by the hundreds in winter. Once endangered by hunting and pesticides, Bald Eagles have flourished under protection."
Purple Gallinule,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75229331-1900px.jpg,6-8 eggs,3.3x2.2cm,"Creamy white with small, irregular brown spots.",20,21,"Covered with black down, able to leave nest within one day. Fed by parents.
",730,1,2555,7,"Lurking in the marshes of the extreme southeastern U.S. lives one of the most vividly colored birds in all of North America. Purple Gallinules combine cherry red, sky blue, moss green, aquamarine, indigo, violet, and school-bus yellow, a color palette that blends surprisingly well with tropical and subtropical wetlands. Watch for these long-legged, long-toed birds stepping gingerly across water lilies and other floating vegetation as they hunt frogs and invertebrates or pick at tubers."
Atlantic puffin,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75224141-1900px.jpg,1 egg,5.9x4.4cm,Dull white.,36,74,Covered in dark gray down.,1825,1,10950,30,"A sharply dressed black-and-white seabird with a huge, multicolored bill, the Atlantic Puffin is often called the clown of the sea. It breeds in burrows on islands in the North Atlantic, and winters at sea. In flight, puffins flap their small wings frantically to stay aloft—but underwater those wings become powerful flippers that allow the birds to catch small fish one by one until they have a beak full. This long-lived bird, once widely hunted, is reestablishing its small range in the U.S., although warming ocean waters are causing breeding failures in other parts of the North Atlantic."
Mallard,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75711041-1900px.jpg,1-13 eggs,5.3x3.9cm,Unmarked creamy to grayish or greenish buff.,23,24,Newly hatched birds are covered in down and alert; they are ready to leave the nest within 13–16 hours.,365,1,1825,5,"If someone at a park is feeding bread to ducks, chances are there are Mallards in the fray. Perhaps the most familiar of all ducks, Mallards occur throughout North America and Eurasia in ponds and parks as well as wilder wetlands and estuaries. The male’s gleaming green head, gray flanks, and black tail-curl arguably make it the most easily identified duck. Mallards have long been hunted for the table, and almost all domestic ducks come from this species."
Scissor-tailed flycatcher,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75365381-1900px.jpg,3-6 eggs,2x1.5cm,"White or creamy with dark red, reddish brown, or purple blotches.",13,27,"Helpless, with reddish brown skin and sparse white down.",365,1,3650,10,"An elegant gray and salmon-pink flycatcher festooned with an absurdly long tail, the Scissor-tailed Flycatcher is the bird to look for on fence wires in the south-central United States. They typically perch in the open, where their long, forked tails make an unmistakable silhouette. The tail proves useful as they expertly catch insects on the wing with sharp midair twists and turns. In late summer and early fall, scissor-tails gather in large, bickering flocks to migrate to Mexico and Central America."
Common raven,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75335511-1900px.jpg,3-7 eggs,4.4x3.1cm,"Green, olive, or blue, often mottled with dark greenish, olive, or purplish brown.",20,48,"Naked except for sparse tufts of grayish down, eyes closed, clumsy, and looking like “grotesque gargoyles” according to a 1945 description.",1095,1,3650,10,"The intriguing Common Raven has accompanied people around the Northern Hemisphere for centuries, following their wagons, sleds, sleighs, and hunting parties in hopes of a quick meal. Ravens are among the smartest of all birds, gaining a reputation for solving ever more complicated problems invented by ever more creative scientists. These big, sooty birds thrive among humans and in the back of beyond, stretching across the sky on easy, flowing wingbeats and filling the empty spaces with an echoing croak."
Mourning dove,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75711541-1900px.jpg,2 eggs,2.6x2.1cm,"Unmarked, white.",14,26,"Helpless, eyes closed, sparsely covered in cream-colored down, unable to hold up head, dependent on adults for warmth.
",85,1,730,2,"A graceful, slender-tailed, small-headed dove that’s common across the continent. Mourning Doves perch on telephone wires and forage for seeds on the ground; their flight is fast and bullet straight. Their soft, drawn-out calls sound like laments. When taking off, their wings make a sharp whistling or whinnying. Mourning Doves are the most frequently hunted species in North America."
Wild turkey,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75221611-1900px.jpg,4-17 eggs,4.9x4.1cm,"Pale yellowish tan, evenly marked with reddish brown or pinkish spots.",25,26,"Well-developed and covered with tawny, brown, pinkish, and gray down.",210,0,1095,3,"Most North American kids learn turkey identification early, by tracing outlines of their hands to make Thanksgiving cards. These big, spectacular birds are an increasingly common sight the rest of the year, too, as flocks stride around woods and clearings like miniature dinosaurs. Courting males puff themselves into feathery balls and fill the air with exuberant gobbling. The Wild Turkey’s popularity at the table led to a drastic decline in numbers, but they have recovered and now occur in every state except Alaska."
Tufted titmouse,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75226111-1900px.jpg,3-9 eggs,1.7x1.4cm,"White to creamy white, spotted with chestnut-red, brown, purple, or lilac.",12,27,"Almost entirely naked and pink, with tufts of down on head and along spine, eyes closed.",365,1,730,2,"A little gray bird with an echoing voice, the Tufted Titmouse is common in eastern deciduous forests and a frequent visitor to feeders. The large black eyes, small, round bill, and brushy crest gives these birds a quiet but eager expression that matches the way they flit through canopies, hang from twig-ends, and drop in to bird feeders. When a titmouse finds a large seed, you’ll see it carry the prize to a perch and crack it with sharp whacks of its stout bill."
Black vulture,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75264421-1900px.jpg,1-3 eggs,6.6x4.5cm,"Pale green or sometimes bluish white, usually with a few large brown blotches on the larger end.",38,108,"Helpless and covered with thick yellowish or pinkish down, with open eyes.",1095,1,3650,10,"With sooty black plumage, a bare black head, and neat white stars under the wingtips, Black Vultures are almost dapper. Whereas Turkey Vultures are lanky birds with teetering flight, Black Vultures are compact birds with broad wings, short tails, and powerful wingbeats. The two species often associate: the Black Vulture makes up for its poor sense of smell by following Turkey Vultures to carcasses. Highly social birds with fierce family loyalty, Black Vultures share food with relatives, feeding young for months after they’ve fledged."
Osprey,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75712441-1900px.jpg,1-4 eggs,5.5x4.2cm,Cream to pinkish cinnamon; wreathed and spotted with reddish brown.,36,86,Capable of limited motion. Covered with down and with eyes open.,1095,1,2555,7,"Unique among North American raptors for its diet of live fish and ability to dive into water to catch them, Ospreys are common sights soaring over shorelines, patrolling waterways, and standing on their huge stick nests, white heads gleaming. These large, rangy hawks do well around humans and have rebounded in numbers following the ban on the pesticide DDT. Hunting Ospreys are a picture of concentration, diving with feet outstretched and yellow eyes sighting straight along their talons."
American robin,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75242661-1900px.jpg,3-5 eggs,2.8x2.1cm,Sky blue or blue-green and unmarked.,12,25,"Helpless at birth, mostly naked with spare whitish down.",365,0,730,2,"The quintessential early bird, American Robins are common sights on lawns across North America, where you often see them tugging earthworms out of the ground. Robins are popular birds for their warm orange breast, cheery song, and early appearance at the end of winter. Though they’re familiar town and city birds, American Robins are at home in wilder areas, too, including mountain forests and Alaskan wilderness."
Peregrine falcon,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75712891-1900px.jpg,2-5 eggs,5x4cm,"Pale creamy to brownish, dotted or blotched with brown, red, or purple.",29,64,"Helpless, covered in whitish down, with eyes closed, weighing about 1.5 ounces.",1095,1,4380,12,"Powerful and fast-flying, the Peregrine Falcon hunts medium-sized birds, dropping down on them from high above in a spectacular stoop. They were virtually eradicated from eastern North America by pesticide poisoning in the middle 20th century. After significant recovery efforts, Peregrine Falcons have made an incredible rebound and are now regularly seen in many large cities and coastal areas."
Black-billed magpie,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75263001-1900px.jpg,1-9 eggs,3x2cm,Tan or olive-brown with variable amount of dark brown speckles,16,40,Helpless and naked with pink skin. Eyes are closed for the first 7 days.,365,1,1277.5,3.5,"Black-billed Magpies are familiar and entertaining birds of western North America. They sit on fenceposts and road signs or flap across rangelands, their white wing patches flashing and their very long tails trailing behind them. This large, flashy relative of jays and crows is a social creature, gathering in numbers to feed at carrion. They’re also vocal birds and keep up a regular stream of raucous or querulous calls."
Snowy egret,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75364241-1900px.jpg,2-6 eggs,4.1x2.3cm,Pale greenish blue.,24,44,Semi-helpless and covered with white down.,730,1,5475,15,"Among the most elegant of the herons, the slender Snowy Egret sets off immaculate white plumage with black legs and brilliant yellow feet. Those feet seem to play a role in stirring up or herding small aquatic animals as the egret forages. Breeding Snowy Egrets grow filmy, curving plumes that once fetched astronomical prices in the fashion industry, endangering the species. Early conservationists rallied to protect egrets by the early twentieth century, and this species is once again a common sight in shallow coastal wetlands."
Canada goose,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75298411-1900px.jpg,2-8 eggs,8.3x5.6cm,Creamy white.,25,67,"Hatchlings are covered with yellowish down and their eyes are open. They leave the nest when 1-2 days old, depending on weather, and can walk, swim, feed, and even dive. They have enough energy remaining in their yolk sac to survive 2 days before feeding.",730,1,3650,10,"The big, black-necked Canada Goose with its signature white chinstrap mark is a familiar and widespread bird of fields and parks. Thousands of “honkers” migrate north and south each year, filling the sky with long V-formations. But as lawns have proliferated, more and more of these grassland-adapted birds are staying put in urban and suburban areas year-round, where some people regard them as pests."
Pygmy nuthatch,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75714301-1900px.jpg,5-9 eggs,1.4x1.1cm,"White, speckled with reddish brown or purplish brown.",12,26,"Helpless, with eyes closed and tan-pink skin covered with smoky gray down.",365,1,2920,8,"Small even by nuthatch standards, Pygmy Nuthatches are tiny bundles of hyperactive energy that climb up and down ponderosa pines giving rubber-ducky calls to their flockmates. Their buffy-white underparts set off a crisp brown head, slate-gray back, and sharp, straight bill. Pygmy Nuthatches breed in large extended-family groups, which is one reason why you’ll often see a half-dozen at a time. Look for them in open forests of older ponderosa pines across the West."
Northern mockingbird,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75712191-1900px.jpg,2-6 eggs,2x1.6cm,Pale blue or greenish white splotched with red or brown.,12,24,"Naked, blind, helpless with light gray down.",365,1,2920,8,"If you’ve been hearing an endless string of 10 or 15 different birds singing outside your house, you might have a Northern Mockingbird in your yard. These slender-bodied gray birds apparently pour all their color into their personalities. They sing almost endlessly, even sometimes at night, and they flagrantly harass birds that intrude on their territories, flying slowly around them or prancing toward them, legs extended, flaunting their bright white wing patches."
Painted bunting,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75712701-1900px.jpg,3-4 eggs,1.8x1.4cm,"Grayish or pale bluish white, with fine speckles of brown and gray.",11,20,"Helpless and nearly naked, with some light down, weighing less than a tenth of an ounce.",730,1,3650,10,"With their vivid fusion of blue, green, yellow, and red, male Painted Buntings seem to have flown straight out of a child’s coloring book. Females and immatures are a distinctive bright green with a pale eyering. These fairly common songbirds breed in the coastal Southeast and in the south-central U.S., where they often come to feeders. They are often caught and sold illegally as cage birds, particularly in Mexico and the Caribbean, a practice that puts pressure on their breeding populations."
Horned lark,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75223871-1900px.jpg,2-5 eggs,1.8x1.3cm,Dark pearl gray to pale gray spotted with cinnamon brown or brownish-olive.,11,19,"Helpless, covered in buffy down.",,1,365,1,"Look carefully at a bare, brown field, especially in winter, and you may be surprised to see it crawling with little brown shapes. When they turn, you may see a neat yellow face, black mask, and tiny black “horns” waving in the breeze. Horned Larks are widespread songbirds of fields, deserts, and tundra, where they forage for seeds and insects, and sing a high, tinkling song. Though they are still common, they have undergone a sharp decline in the last half-century."
Ruby-throated hummingbird,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75367911-1900px.jpg,1-3 eggs,1.2x0.8cm,"Tiny, white, weighting about half a gram, or less than one-fiftieth of an ounce.",12,30,"Naked apart from two tracts of gray down along the back, eyes closed, clumsy.",365,0,1095,3,"A flash of green and red, the Ruby-throated Hummingbird is eastern North America’s sole breeding hummingbird. These brilliant, tiny, precision-flying creatures glitter like jewels in the full sun, then vanish with a zip toward the next nectar source. Feeders and flower gardens are great ways to attract these birds, and some people turn their yards into buzzing clouds of hummingbirds each summer. Enjoy them while they’re around; by early fall they’re bound for Central America, with many crossing the Gulf of Mexico in a single flight."
Roseate spoonbill,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75367951-1900px.jpg,1-5 eggs,5.7x4.1cm,"Whitish to pale green, evenly covered with brown spots.",22,57,Pink skinned and covered with white down. Eyed closed and unable to stand.,112,1,3650,10,"The flamboyant Roseate Spoonbill looks like it came straight out of a Dr. Seuss book with its bright pink feathers, red eye staring out from a partly bald head, and giant spoon-shaped bill. Groups sweep their spoonbills through shallow fresh or salt waters snapping up crustaceans and fish. They fly with necks outstretched, to and from foraging and nesting areas along the coastal southeastern U.S., and south to South America. These social birds nest and roost in trees and shrubs with other large wading birds."
California condor,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75298111-1900px.jpg,1 egg,9.2x6.2cm,Pale blue-green bleaching to white or creamy.,53,216,"Helpless, covered in white down with eyes open.",2190,1,21900,60,"The spectacular but endangered California Condor is the largest bird in North America. These superb gliders travel widely to feed on carcasses of deer, pigs, cattle, sea lions, whales, and other animals. Pairs nest in caves high on cliff faces. The population fell to just 22 birds in the 1980s, but there are now about 275 free-flying birds in California, Utah, Arizona, and Baja California with more than 160 in captivity. Lead poisoning remains a severe threat to their long-term prospects."
Black-necked stilt,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75225891-1900px.jpg,2-5 eggs,3.7x2.9cm,Tawny olive to light drab with dark brown speckling.​,24,,Covered with down and able to run awkwardly within about 2 hours of hatching.,730,1,7300,20,"Black-necked Stilts are among the most stately of the shorebirds, with long rose-pink legs, a long thin black bill, and elegant black-and-white plumage that make them unmistakable at a glance. They move deliberately when foraging, walking slowly through wetlands in search of tiny aquatic prey. When disturbed, stilts are vociferous, to put it mildly, and their high, yapping calls carry for some distance. ​"
Barred owl,https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/assets/photo/75266781-1900px.jpg,1-5 eggs,4.3x3.8cm,"Pure white, with a rough surface.",28,56,"Helpless and covered with white down, with closed eyes.",730,1,3650,10,"The Barred Owl’s hooting call, “Who cooks for you? Who cooks for you-all?” is a classic sound of old forests and treed swamps. But this attractive owl, with soulful brown eyes and brown-and-white-striped plumage, can also pass completely unnoticed as it flies noiselessly through the dense canopy or snoozes on a tree limb. Originally a bird of the east, during the twentieth century it spread through the Pacific Northwest and southward into California."
